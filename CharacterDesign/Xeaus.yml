    Vampire:
        A vampire that is 6 feet and 3 inches
        Wears a black frock coat, black fedora, black dress pants, and black dress shoes
        Bear chested

        The handle is made of ebony
        The blade is curved backward 
        The blade is bone white with a groove along the contour near the spine side, going from the guard to the tip
        The groove moves blood down the blade to be drunk from the skull later (MAKE MOVE)
